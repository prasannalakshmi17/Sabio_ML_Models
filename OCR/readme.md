**OCR**

OCR text extraction for images

This project attempts to extract text from Images using Object Character Recognition. Additionally, it attemps to flag images as appropriate or inappropriate given the text extracted from the image. 
It is a technology that converts images of text into machine-readable text. This means that you can use a computer to edit, search, and store the text, just like you would with any other text document.
